# Vercel Build Fix - Tailwind CSS v4 Issue

## Problem
Vercel build was failing with error:
```
Error: Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/postcss'
```

## Root Cause
When we ran `npm uninstall firebase-admin`, it also removed some packages including Tailwind CSS dependencies. The `package-lock.json` became corrupted and was missing the proper dependency tree for `@tailwindcss/postcss`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Regenerated package-lock.json
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### 2. Verified Build Locally
```bash
npm run build
# âœ… Build succeeded
```

### 3. Committed Fresh package-lock.json
```bash
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "fix: regenerate package-lock.json with correct Tailwind CSS v4 dependencies"
git push
```

## What's in package.json

### Tailwind CSS v4 (devDependencies):
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4",
    "tailwindcss": "^4"
  }
}
```

### PostCSS Config (postcss.config.mjs):
```javascript
const config = {
  plugins: {
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": {},
  },
};
export default config;
```

## Verification Steps

### On Vercel:
1. New deployment should trigger automatically
2. Check build logs for:
   - âœ… `npm install` completes successfully
   - âœ… `prisma generate` runs
   - âœ… `next build` succeeds
   - âœ… No "Cannot find module" errors

### Expected Success Output:
```
âœ” Generated Prisma Client (v6.18.0)
âœ“ Compiled successfully
âœ“ Linting and checking validity of types
âœ“ Generating static pages (24/24)
Build completed successfully
```

## Why This Happened

1. Running `npm uninstall firebase-admin` removed 103 packages
2. Some of these packages were shared dependencies with Tailwind CSS
3. The package-lock.json wasn't updated correctly
4. Vercel used the corrupted lockfile, missing `@tailwindcss/postcss`

## Prevention

Always regenerate package-lock.json after major uninstalls:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build  # Test locally first
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore: regenerate package-lock.json"
```

## Status
- âœ… Local build: **PASSING**
- ðŸ”„ Vercel deployment: **IN PROGRESS**
- ðŸ“¦ Dependencies: **FIXED**
