2. Click "Book Session"
3. Select date/time
4. Submit booking
5. Check email for confirmation

### 6. Test Email Notifications
**Prerequisites:**

   - Explore Skills → /listings
   - My Bookings → dashboard?tab=bookings
   - My Listings → dashboard?tab=listings
   - Projects → /projects
   - Credits → /credits
3. All should work without 404 errors

## 🚨 Known Limitations & Future Work

### Phase 3 (Skipped for MVP):
- ❌ Automated testing (Jest, Playwright)
- ❌ Admin dashboard
- ❌ Advanced analytics
- ❌ Razorpay payment integration (stub ready)
- ❌ Push notifications
- ❌ Email preferences
- ❌ Multi-language support

### Frontend Gaps:
- 📝 Bookings tab shows placeholder (needs API integration)
- 📝 Listings tab shows placeholder (needs API integration)
- 📝 Stats cards show "0" (needs real data from API)
- 📝 Profile editing page (uses existing profile page)
- 📝 Project detail page (basic list only)
- 📝 Review submission UI (API ready, UI pending)

### API Endpoints (All Working):
- ✅ POST/GET/PUT `/api/bookings`
- ✅ POST/GET `/api/listings`
- ✅ POST/GET `/api/credits`
- ✅ POST/GET `/api/reviews`
- ✅ POST/GET `/api/projects`
- ✅ GET `/api/users/[id]`
- ✅ POST `/api/upload` (Cloudinary)
- ✅ GET `/api/cron/cleanup`
- ✅ GET `/api/cron/reminders`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### 404 Errors on Dashboard Links
**Status:** ✅ FIXED
- Updated navigation to use existing pages
- All sidebar links now work correctly

### Redis Connection Errors During Build
**Status:** ✅ EXPECTED
- Redis not accessible in build environment
- Works perfectly in production runtime
- Not a bug - just a build-time warning

### Email Not Sending
**Check:**
1. Gmail SMTP credentials in .env
2. App password (not regular password)
3. Email verification token generated
4. Check spam folder
5. Check Vercel logs: `vercel logs --follow`

### Map Not Loading
**Check:**
1. Leaflet CSS imported in global styles
2. Dynamic import with `ssr: false` used
3. Browser console for errors
4. OpenStreetMap tile server reachable

### Booking Conflicts
**Expected:** System prevents double-booking same time slot
**Solution:** Choose different time or check provider's availability

## 📊 Database Seed Data (Optional)

To test with sample data, create seed script:

```typescript
// prisma/seed.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
  // Create test user
  const user = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      email: 'test@example.com',
      name: 'Test User',
      locationLat: 28.6139,
      locationLng: 77.2090,
      locationCity: 'New Delhi',
      credits: 100,
    }
  })

  // Create test listing
  await prisma.listing.create({
    data: {
      title: 'Guitar Lessons',
      description: 'Learn guitar from beginner to intermediate',
      skillTags: ['guitar', 'music'],
      ownerId: user.id,
      lat: 28.6139,
      lng: 77.2090,
      priceCents: 50000,
      durationMins: 60,
      isActive: true,
    }
  })

  console.log('✅ Database seeded!')
}

main()
  .catch(console.error)
  .finally(() => prisma.$disconnect())
```

Run: `npx prisma db seed`
